# Introduction to Adaptive Protection in Microsoft Purview 

In today's digital world, keeping company information safe is more
important than ever. Data leaks and cyber threats are growing, so
businesses need smart, easy-to-use tools to keep sensitive information
secure. Microsoft Purview offers adaptive protection---a set of advanced
tools that can automatically adjust security measures based on what's
happening in real time. This article explains adaptive protection in
simple terms, shares how it benefits everyday users, and provides clear
steps for getting started. 

# What Makes Adaptive Protection Special? 

Adaptive protection in Microsoft Purview is not just a set of fixed
rules. Instead, it uses advanced technologies like machine learning and
analytics to automatically assess risks and adjust security settings as
needed. This means, rather than relying on outdated policies that
require constant manual updates, adaptive protection responds instantly
to new threats and changing user activities, helping keep your most
valuable information safe every day. 

# Key Principles of Adaptive Protection 

- **Automatic Policy Updates:** Changes protection settings on its own
  when new risks are found. 

<!-- -->

- **Smart Activity Tracking:** Watches for unusual user actions, like
  trying to access files at odd times or from new devices. 

<!-- -->

- **Risk Reviews:** Checks for possible dangers and increases safety
  measures if something suspicious happens. 

<!-- -->

- **Quick Responses:** Takes action right away---like blocking access or
  sending alerts---if it notices higher risk. 

<!-- -->

- **Works with Other Microsoft Tools:** Connects easily with other
  Microsoft programs for a complete approach to keeping data safe. 

Easy-to-Understand Features of Adaptive Protection 

Adaptive protection provides many helpful features that make it easier
for everyone in an organization to keep information secure. Here's a
closer look, with real-world examples: 

1\. Real-Time Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 

This feature helps prevent sensitive information, such as payment
details or personal records, from leaving the company by accident. For
example, if someone tries to send a file containing customer information
to an external email address, the system can block the email or ask the
user for extra confirmation. 

2\. Insider Risk Management 

Adaptive protection can spot suspicious behavior inside your
organization. For example, if an employee suddenly starts downloading a
lot of confidential files, the system can automatically limit their
access and alert the security team. This helps stop problems before they
grow bigger. 

3\. Automatic Data Tagging and Classification 

The system can automatically label documents based on their
content---for instance, marking files as \"confidential\" or \"internal
use only.\" This makes sure the right rules are always applied, no
matter where the data travels. 

4\. Easy Connection with Microsoft Defender and Sentinel 

Adaptive protection smoothly links with Microsoft's other security
tools, allowing for shared alerts, faster investigations, and
coordinated action across all your apps and services. 

5\. Detailed Policy Settings 

You can set specific rules based on job roles, departments, or even
devices. For instance, only the Human Resources team might be able to
see employee records, while others can't. 

6\. Risk-Based Access Control 

Instead of having the same access all the time, users' permissions can
change depending on their recent actions. If someone's behavior seems
risky, their ability to access important documents can be paused until
reviewed.

Purview **

Getting started with adaptive protection is straightforward. Here's how
you can set it up:

  DLP** or **Insider risk management**. 

<!-- -->

Step 4: Create and Adjust Protection Rules 

- Go to **Policy** management and select **Create policy**. 

<!-- -->

- Pick a template, such as for financial or personal data, or make your
  own rules. 

<!-- -->

- Set who the policy applies to---like specific users, groups, or
  devices. 

<!-- -->

- Choose what triggers the rules, such as risky actions or alerts from
  other systems. 

<!-- -->

  alerts, or asking for more proof of identity.
