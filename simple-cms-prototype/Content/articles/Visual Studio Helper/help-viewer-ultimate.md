# What is the Microsoft Help Viewer?

> 10/02/2025
>
> You can use Microsoft Help Viewer to install, view, and manage local
> documentation installs for Microsoft products and technologies on
> local computers. These products include Visual Studio,
>
> .NET, language reference, SQL Server, and Windows development. With
> Help Viewer, you, and any users you support, can:

- Download documentation, which are also referred to as books. This is
  useful when you want to access documentation while working offline.

- Search and find topics through the table of contents, book index, or
  even full-text search.

- View, bookmark, and print content.

## Get started

> To install Help Viewer, see [Microsoft Help Viewer
> installation](#microsoft-help-viewer-installation).
>
> To start reading help topics in the Help Viewer rather than online, go
> to the **Help** menu in Visual Studio, and then choose **Set Help
> Preference** \> **Launch in Help Viewer**.

![](media/image4.png)

> **Tip**
> Another way to download content locally so you can view it when you don't have an internet connection is to download a PDF version of it. Many documentation sets on Microsoft Learn include a link at the bottom of the table of contents to download a PDF file that contains all the articles for that TOC.

## Tour the Help Viewer window

> You can find information in installed content by using the navigation
> tabs, view installed content in the topic tab or tabs, and manage
> content by using the **Manage Content** tab. You can also perform
> additional tasks by using the buttons on the toolbar and find
> additional
>
> information in the lower-right corner of the window.
>
> The following information describes the default setup for Help Viewer.
> You can also [customize](#customize-the-help-viewer) [it's layout and
> settings](#customize-the-help-viewer).

### Navigation tabs

ﾉ **Expand table**

| **Tab** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| Contents | Displays installed content as a hierarchy (table of contents). You can specify criteria to filter the titles that appear. |
| Index | Displays an alphabetical list of indexed terms. You can search the index, specify criteria to filter the entries, and require that index entries either contain or start with text that you specify. |
| Favorites | You can "favorite" topics by choosing the **Add to Favorites** button, and the topics appear in this tab. The **History** section displays a list of topics that you've viewed recently. |
| Search | Provides a text box where you can search for terms anywhere in the content, including code and topic titles. |

### View topics

> Each topic appears in its own tab, and you can open multiple topics at
> the same time.

### Manage content

> You can install, update, move, and delete content by using the
> **Manage Content** tab. At the top of the tab, you can use the
> **Installation source** control to specify whether to install books
> from a network location or from a disk or URI. The **Local store
> path** box shows where books are installed on the local computer, and
> you can move them to a different location by choosing the **Move**
> button.
>
> The content list shows which books you can install or have already
> installed, whether an update is available, and how large each book is.
> You can install or remove one or more books by choosing the
> appropriate **Add** or **Remove** links and then choosing the
> **Update** button under the **Pending changes** pane. If updates are
> available for any books that you've already installed, you can refresh
> that content by choosing the **Click here to download now** link at
> the bottom
>
> of the window. In addition, all installed books are refreshed if
> updates are available when you install additional books.

### Keyboard shortcuts

> Find the list of keyboard shortcuts in the article, "[Shortcut keys in

# Install and manage local content

> 03/11/2024
>
> By using the Microsoft Help Viewer, you can add, remove, update, and
> move the Help content that is installed on your computer to fit your
> software development needs.
>
> To manage content on your local computer, you must log on with an
> account that has administrator permissions. In addition, you might not
> be able to manage local content if you work in an enterprise
> environment, because system administrators might make those decisions
> for your organization. For more information, see the [Help Viewer
> administrator
> guide](#deploy-and-manage-local-help-installations-for-network-environments).

## Change the content installation source

> By default, Help Viewer installs content by using a Microsoft online
> service as the source. You generally shouldn't change your content
> source unless you work in an enterprise environment for which a system
> administrator has already installed content in another location.

### To change the content installation source

1.  On the **Manage Content** tab, choose the **Disk** option button.

2.  Perform one of the following steps:

    - Enter the path of an *.msha* file or the URL of a service
      endpoint.

    - Choose the Browse (**...**) button to navigate to an *.msha* file.

    - In the list, choose the entry that was used most recently.

### To download and install content

1.  Choose the **Manage Content** tab.

2.  In the content list, choose the **Add** link next to the book or
    books that you want to download and install.

> The book is added to the **Pending changes** list, and the estimated
> size of the book or books that you specified appears below that list.
> Because some books share topics, the total download size of multiple
> books might be smaller than the result of adding together the sizes of
> every book that you specified.

3.  Choose the **Update** button.

> The book or books that you specified are installed along with any
> updates for books that you already have on your computer. Installation
> times vary, but you can view the progress in the status bar.

## Remove local content

> Requirements:

- Client computers must have access to the internet.

- Users must have administrator rights to update, add, or remove the
  local Help content after it has been installed.

> Caveats:

- The default source for Help will still be online.

### Example

> The following example installs English content for Visual Studio to a
> client computer.

#### To install English content from the internet

1.  Choose **Start** and then choose **Run**.

2.  Type the following:

3.  Press **Enter**.

## Deploy pre-installed local Help content on client computers

> You can install a set of content from online to one computer, and then
> copy that installed set of content to other computers.
>
> Requirements:

- The computer you install the set of content to must have access to the
  internet.

- Users must have administrator rights to update, add, or remove the
  local Help content after it has been installed.

> Caveats:

- The default source for Help will still be online.

### Create the content set

> Before you can create the base content set, you must first uninstall
> all local Visual Studio content on the target computer.

#### To uninstall local help

1.  In the Help Viewer, choose the **Manage Content** tab.

2.  Navigate to the Visual Studio document set.

3.  Choose **Remove** next to each sub-item.

4.  Choose **Update** to uninstall.

5.  Browse to
    *%ProgramData%\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2\Catalogs\VisualStudio15* and
    verify that the folder only contains the file *catalogType.xml*.

> Once you have removed all previously installed local Visual Studio
> Help content, you are ready to download the base content set.

#### To download the content

1.  In the Help Viewer, choose the **Manage Content** tab.

2.  Under **Recommended Documentation** or **Available Documentation**,
    navigate to the documentation sets you want to download and then
    choose **Add**.

3.  Choose **Update**.

> Next, you need to package the content so it can be deployed to client
> computers.

#### To package the content

1.  Create a folder to copy the content to for later deployment. For
    example: *C:\VSHelp*.

2.  Open *cmd.exe* with Administrator permissions.

3.  Navigate to the folder you created in step 1.

4.  Type the following:

> For example:

### Deploy the content

1.  Create a network share and copy the help content to that location.

> For example, copy the content in *C:\VSHelp* to *\\myserver\VSHelp*.

2.  Create a *.bat* file to contain the deployment script for the help
    content. Since the client could possibly have a read lock on any of
    the files being deleted as part of the push, you should have the
    client shut down prior to pushing updates. For example:

> Windows Command Prompt
>
> REM - copy pre-ripped content to ProgramData
>
> Xcopy %~dp0HelpLibrary2
> %SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2\\ /y
>
> /e /k /o
>
> if ERRORLEVEL 1 ECHO \*\*\* ERROR COPYING Help Library files to
> ProgramData (%ERRORLEVEL%)

3.  Run the *.bat* file on the local machines that you want to install
    the Help content on.

# Find articles in the Help Viewer

> 06/25/2025
>
> You use the table of contents (TOC), index, and search to find
> articles in the Help Viewer. This article describes the features of
> the Help Viewer that can help you find articles more quickly.
>
> For historical reasons, articles in Help Viewer are referred to as
> *Help topics* or just *topics*.

## Filter the Table of Contents

> You can filter the TOC to narrow the scope of topics that appear in
> the **Contents** tab. Titles appear in the list only if they contain
> the root of the term that you specify. For example, if you specify
> "troubleshooting" as a filter, only titles that contain "troubleshoot"
> or "troubleshooting" appear. Nodes whose titles don't contain the term
> are collapsed to a single node with an ellipsis (**...**).

1.  Choose the **Contents** tab.

2.  In the **Filter Contents** text box, enter a term.

### Synchronize a topic with the TOC

> If you have opened a topic using the index or full-text search
> features, you can determine where this topic is in the TOC by
> synchronizing the TOC with the topic window.

1.  View a topic.

2.  Click the **Show Topic in Contents** button on the toolbar, or press
    **Ctrl**+**S**. The **Contents** tab opens and displays the topic's
    location in the TOC.

## Find topics by using the Help Viewer index

> The index contains a list of keywords that are associated with topics
> in the installed content.
>
> Each topic might have more than one keyword associated with it, and
> each keyword might be
>
> associated with more than one topic. Use this index in the same way as
> you would use an index in a book.

### To find a topic by using the index

> On the **Index** tab, perform either of the following tasks:

- Specify the keyword to search for in the text box. For example,
  specify "update" to find topics with keywords such as "update,"
  "updated," and "updating."

> By choosing the filter button near the top of the tab, you can display
> either all entries that contain the text that you specify or only
> those entries that start with the text that you
>
> specify.

- Scroll through the index, and choose a keyword.

> If the keyword that you specify is associated with only one topic, it
> appears. Otherwise, a list of all topics that are associated with that
> keyword appears.

## Use the Search feature to find articles

> You can use the full-text search feature of Microsoft Help Viewer to
> locate all topics that
>
> contain a particular word. You can also refine and customize your
> search by using wildcard expressions, logical operators, and advanced
> search operators.

## To perform a full-text search

1.  Use one of these methods to open the Help Viewer **Search** tab:

    - In the **Help Viewer** window, select the **Search** tab.

    - On the keyboard, select **Ctrl**+**E**.

2.  In the search box, enter the word that you want to find.

3.  In the search query, specify any logical or advanced search
    operators that you'd like to apply to the search. To search all
    available help, don't use operators.

4.  Select the **Enter** key.

> A search returns a maximum of 200 hits, by default, and displays them
> in the search results area. Version information for each result may
> appear, depending on the content.

5.  To view a topic, select its title from the results list.

## Full-text search tips

> You can create more targeted searches that return only those topics
> that interest you, if you understand how syntax affects your query.
> The syntax includes special characters, reserved words, and filters.
> This section provides tips, procedures, and detailed syntax
> information to help you better craft your queries.

### General guidelines

> The following table includes some basic rules and guidelines for
> developing search queries in help.

ﾉ **Expand table**

<table style="width:95%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 16%" />
<col style="width: 77%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Syntax</strong></th>
<th><blockquote>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
</blockquote></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Case sensitivity</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Searches aren't case-sensitive. Develop your search criteria by using
uppercase or lowercase characters. For example, "OLE" and "ole" return
the same results.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character combinations</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>You can't search only for individual letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9).
If you try to search for certain reserved words, such as "and," "from,"
and "with," they're ignored. For more information, see <a
href="#words-ignored-in-searches-stop-words">Words ignored in
searches</a> later in this article.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evaluation order</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Search queries are evaluated from left to right.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Search syntax

> You might enter a search string that includes multiple words, such as
> "word1 word2." That string is equivalent to typing "word1 AND word2."
> Searches that use the AND operator return
>
> only topics that contain all the individual words in the search
> string.

### Filters

> You can further restrict search results by using advanced search
> operators. Help includes three categories that you can use to filter
> results of a full-text search: Title, Code, and Keyword.

### Ranking of search results

> The search algorithm applies certain criteria to help rank search
> results higher or lower in the results list. In general:

- Content that includes search words in the title is ranked higher than
  content that doesn't.

- Content that includes search words in close proximity is ranked higher
  than content that doesn't.

- Content that contains a higher density of the search words is ranked
  higher than content that has a lower density of the search words.

### Words ignored in searches (stop words)

> Commonly occurring words or numbers, which are sometimes called stop
> words, are automatically ignored during a full-text search. For
> example, if you search for the phrase "pass through," search results
> display topics that contain the word "pass" but not "through."

## Logical and advanced operators in search expressions

##

> You can use logical operators and advanced search operators to refine
> your search of the Help content in **Help Viewer**.

### Logical operators

> Logical operators specify how multiple search terms should be combined
> in a search query. The following table shows the logical operators
> AND, OR, NOT and NEAR.
